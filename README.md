## About

Wootili-View is a project designed to enhance your Wooting device by providing an ambient lighting effect. This software allows you to map a downscaled version of your screen onto your Wooting keyboard, creating a dynamic and immersive ambilight experience.

## How It Works

The functionality of this project is straightforward. The program captures screenshots of your specified display, downscaling them to match the size of your Wooting device's RGB layout. Subsequently, it maps the colors from the downscaled screenshots to the corresponding keys on your Wooting device, producing a captivating ambilight effect.

## Getting Started
